# NLP-parser

# Input: 5 test images of the same table and their corresponding OCR outputs

# Task: Review the 5 test images in the Images folder and their corresponding OCR outputs in
# the OCR folder. Use key information from the images and OCR output (for example, bounding
# boxes, text or confidences) to build a general parser that will work properly on additional data
# (images of the same table with their OCR outputs).
